Hi David,

Thanks for your patience while I looked into this. We don't allow commercialization yet, but, since this is content for a freely-available course, you can use the images in your course as long as you adhere to our terms of use.

is there anything else we can help with?

Best,

Dear OpenAI:

I have a licensing question. I've developed a freely-available course 
on how to develop secure software. Its content is available to use/modify via the 
Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license. Students can take the course 
for free via the Linux Foundation Training site & also via edX (for those who prefer edX). 
More info: https://openssf.org/training/courses/

Could I use Dall-E and Dall-E-2 to generate images that would then be 
included in the course, to help students understand its concepts? 
I would *not* provide a general web API to generate new images, I'd just 
include the generated images.

I reviewed your policy here: 
https://labs.openai.com/policies/content-policy 
However, I couldn't figure out if this was allowed or not.

I would be *delighted* to give OpenAI credit if it's allowed.

Thanks!!
