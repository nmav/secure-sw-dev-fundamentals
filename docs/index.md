If you want to *learn* using the online tutorials, you're in the *wrong place*.
Instead, *please* go to the
**[Developing Secure Software (LFD121) entry page](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/developing-secure-software-lfd121/)**
so you can learn how to develop secure software.
It's free, and its certificate of completion is free.

The [OpenSSF page about this course](https://openssf.org/training/courses/) provides some broader context about the course.
The learning material also available via [edX](http://edx.org/professional-certificate/linuxfoundationx-secure-software-development-fundamentals?utm_medium=partner-marketing&utm_source=affiliate&utm_campaign=openssf&utm_content=openssforg-securedevelopmentpc). but the edX certificate of completion is not free.

However, if you want to view the course material as a book, you're in the right place! Please view the [*Developing Secure Software (LFD121) course material as a book*](./lfd121).
